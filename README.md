# LoanPrediction

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting loan repayment outcomes using machine learning. It provides a systematic approach to minimize credit risks and support better lending decisions for financial institutions.

## Features
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset.
- Preprocess data by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
- Train and evaluate machine learning models like Logistic Regression and Random Forest.

## Workflow
Problem Definition: Establish the goal of predicting loan repayment.
Data Import and Analysis: Load and explore the dataset.
Data Preprocessing: Prepare the data for modeling.
Model Development: Train and evaluate various machine learning models.
Model Selection: Choose the most accurate and reliable model.

## Dataset
Place the dataset file in the project directory before running the notebook. If using an external dataset, update the notebook to load the correct path.

## Results
The project includes visualizations and performance metrics to demonstrate the model's ability to predict loan repayment outcomes effectively.

## Requirements
Ensure the following Python libraries are installed:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
